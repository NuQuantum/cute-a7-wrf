Compact Universal Timing Endpoint Based on White Rabbit with Xilinx Artix7

The Cute-WR series are standalone White Rabbit Node implementations on FPGA Mezzanine Card form factor. The idea is to have a compact, low-cost and common WR NIC for synchronous DAQ front-ends and other applications!
Cute-WR shows the feasibility of the idea; while the Cute-WR-DP expands the Cute-WR to two SFP ports that can support various operation modes.
The Cute-WR-A7 is the enhanced version of the CUTE-WR-DP with an Xilinx Artix7 series FPGA. It inherits similar interfaces from Cute-WR-DP: two SFP ports, two SMA/LEMO connectors, FMC form factor with LPC connector, etc.
The three operation modes of Cute-WR-DP are also supported by Cute-WR-A7:


Normal mode (Cute-WR-A7-NM)

In Normal mode, Cute-WR-A7 acts as a normal WR node with one SFP
port (SFP0).



Cascade mode (Cute-WR-A7-CM)

In CM mode, two ports act as one down-link (SFP1) and one
up-link (SFP0) to support cascade topology. Two ports also
support a simple switch function for normal Ethernet packets.



Parallel mode (Cute-WR-A7-PM)

In PM mode both ports act as down-link port connect to different
WRS, provide redundancy to improve the reliability for safety
related applications. The current firmware doesn't support this
function.
